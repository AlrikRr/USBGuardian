# Where to download
## Pre-build image
You can download the prebuild image here:

https://usbguardian.wordpress.com/documentation/

While copying the pre-built image, make sure the destination disk is the SD card and not your disk.

* On Linux:
Find the raw disk identifying your SD card (something like /dev/sdX1 where X is a character):
```
df -h
```
The disk is most probably mounted and needs to be unmounted before the copy:
```
umount /dev/sdX1
```
Now you can copy the image to the SD card using dd:
```
dd bs=1M if=2018-02-07_USBGuardian.img of=/dev/sdX
```
* On Windows:
As recommended by the RaspberryPi, use the Win32DiskImager utility to copy the file image to the SD card. You can also use dd for Windows.

Now, youâ€™re ready to go! Just insert your SD card into the Raspberry Pi and set it on!
